            <p>
                I am a citizen of the world who seeks for a simple life and a good cup of tea. My name is Nichada. I am a <abbr title="Very Important Person">VIP</abbr> member of the horse club, which is 9 <sup>th</sup> anniversary this year. Below, my one of the inspiration quotes for when I need a <em>little motivation</em>.

            <p>
                One of my favorite things is good movies. I have a passion for the <b>music</b>. Nothing would be better than a beautiful day with good music and quality time with my family and friends. My favorite sports are badminton and basketball.
